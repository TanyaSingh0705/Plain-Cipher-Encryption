# Plain-Cipher-Encryption
A python program to perform encryption and decryption on a plain text and using a key converting it into cipher text. The key is auto-generated uniquely  each time 
Initially you give  a string as input which us to be encrypted
An automatoic key is generated using the length of the inputs string which is not displayed to the end user.
With the help of that key, the string is encrypted and stored safely
On decryption the encrypted message is decrpyted using the same key.
This technique of plain-cipher encryption is used to send confidential message over internet to prevent hazads like eavesdropping.
